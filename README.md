# Daniel Gregoire Portofolio Page

## HTML

My Html section is divided between header, about me, video game projects, programming projects and the contact me page. Each of these has their own dedicated section outlining whats in it. About me doesn't have a description yet of what i want to write in it. The Video game projects and programming proejcts pages doesn't link you to anything yet. The only thing with the page that links you to another website is the Github page. 

## CSS

The CSS has the style choices for the webpage. I tried going for a more teal color palette for the portofolio page because it felt more easy on the eyes.
